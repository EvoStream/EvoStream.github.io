1. To play streams from EMS using webSocket, the following command needs to be executed first on EMS. Access the test pageÂ `demo/evoplayers.html`:

   ```
   http://<WEBSERVER_IP_ADDRESS>/demo/evoplayers.html
   ```

   Enter the EMS IP address and the stream name of the stream you want to play. 

   Just hit **Play** to start streaming!

There are two players available for Websockets. You can stream the same source or stream two different sources at the same time!
