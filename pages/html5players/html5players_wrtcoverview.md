The web real-time communications or much known as the **WebRTC** is a free, open project that provides browsers and mobile applications with Real-Time Communications (RTC) capabilities via simple APIs. 

It is a very exciting, powerful, and highly disruptive cutting-edge technology and standard.  **WebRTC** leverages a set of plugin-free APIs that can be **used** in both desktop and mobile browsers, and is progressively becoming supported by all major modern browser vendors. 

The **WebRTC** initiative is a project supported by Google, Mozilla and Opera, amongst others.â€‹
