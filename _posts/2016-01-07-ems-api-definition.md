Overview
========

This document describes the Application Programming Interface (API) and the Event Notification System presented by the EvoStream Media Server (EMS). The API provides the ability to manipulate the server at runtime. The server can be told to retrieve or create new streams, return information on streams and connections, or even start or stop functional services. The Event Notification System provides a means for the EMS to alert users of certain events that occur within the EMS, such as a new stream is created, a stream has been dropped, server stopped, etc. The EvoStream Media Server API and Event Notification System allows users to tightly integrate with the server without having to write native plugins or modules.

Run-Time API
============

While the EMS has a "great" User Interface, users typically interact with the EMS through the Run-Time API. This API, which is used by the UI, provides a whole suite of ways to interact with the EMS. It can be used to create custom User Interfaces, hook the EMS up to existing systems, integrate it with other pieces of software and much more!

Accessing the Runtime API
-------------------------

### ASCII

The ASCII interface is often the first interface used by users. It can be accessed easily through the telnet application (available on all operating systems) or through common scripting languages.

To access the API via the telnet interface, a telnet application will need to be launched on the same computer that the EMS is running on. The command to open telnet from a command prompt should look something like the following:

```
telnet localhost 1112
```

**Note:**

Telnet may need to be enabled using Windows® operating systems. To do this, go to the *Control Panel -> Programs -> Turn Windows Features on and off*. Turn the Telnet Client program on.

1.	***Turning Telnet Feature On***

Please also note that on Windows®, the default telnet behavior will need to be changed. The local echo and new line mode should be set for proper behavior. Once telnet is launched, exit the telnet session by typing "**ctrl+]**". Then enter the following commands:

```
set localecho
set crlf
```

To return to the Windows® telnet session, press **Enter** / **Return** key.

Once the telnet session is established, type out the desired commands which will be immediately executed on the server after the Enter/Return key is pressed.

An example of a command request and response from a telnet session would be the following:

| **Request**  | version                                                                                                                                                                 |

-	**JSON**

When using the regular ASCII interface, it may be necessary to use a JSON interpreter so that responses can be more human-readable. JSON parsers are available online.


### ASCII CLI

```
telnet localhost 1222
```

This is the user friendly version of the ASCII telnet interface. It offers a readable response without having to parse the JSON results. To access this interface from the command prompt, execute the following:

However, since the objective of this interface is simplicity, there are some parameters that are not included on the display. Thus, for advanced usages and/or configurations, it is better to use the regular ASCII telnet interface.

An example of a command request and response from an ASCLII CLI telnet session would be the following:

| **Request**                                                                                                                                                  | version                              |

### HTTP

To access the API via the HTTP interface, simply make an HTTP request on the server using any browser with the command to be executed. By default, the port used for these HTTP requests is **7777**. The HTTP interface port can be changed in the main configuration file used by the EMS (config.lua).

A general http format request would be the following:

```
http://[EMS IP]:7777/[API]
```

An example of a command request and response from an HTTP session would be the following:

| **Request**  | http://localhost:7777/version                                                                                                                                           |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Response** | {"data":{"banner":"EvoStream Media Server (www.evostream.com) version 1.7.0. build 4153 with hash: 4ab5d9145ae3b4b3dfeb3af5ce6890f015824974 on branch: develop - PacMan |

```
http://IP:7777/[API]?params=([base64 encoded parameters])
```

All of the API functions are available via HTTP, but the request must be formatted slightly different if parameters are included. To make an API call over HTTP, the parameters to be used should be in base64 format.

Sampling a **pullstream** command: 1. Type in the parameters first:

```
(firstParam=XXX secondParam=YYY…)
(uri=rtsp://localhost:5544/vod/mp4.bunny.mp4 localStreamName=bunny)
```

1.	Convert the parameters using a base64 encoder:

**Converted parameter:**

```
dXJpPXJ0c3A6Ly9sb2NhbGhvc3Q6NTU0NC92b2QvbXA0LmJ1bm55Lm1wNCBsb2NhbHN0cmVhbW5hbWU9YnVubnkp
```

1.	The corresponding request in HTTP format would be:

```
http://localhost:7777/pullstream?params= dXJpPXJ0c3A6Ly9sb2NhbGhvc3Q6NTU0NC92b2QvbXA0LmJ1bm55Lm1wNCBsb2NhbHN0cmVhbW5hbWU9YnVubnkp
```

-	**Base64**

A group of similar binary-to-text encoding schemes that represent binary data in an [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) string format by translating it into a [radix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix)-64 representation. There are available base64 encoders online to get the encoded result.

-	**PHP and JavaScript**

PHP and JavaScript functions are also provided. These functions simply wrap the HTTP interface calls and can be found in the EMS Web UI directory.

-	**Securing the API**

By default, the ASCII API is protected and access from any outside computer is prohibited. This can of course be modified within the config.lua file, but keeping this restriction is recommended for maintaining server security.

The HTTP based API is also restricted by default to only local access. However, unlike the ASCII API interface, there are often good reasons to expose the HTTP API. To secure the HTTP based API in this case, you will enable Proxy Authentication on the EWS (details found in the EWS section of this doc). This will enforce that a valid username and password be provided for each and every API call made, ensuring on authorized access to the EMS API.


Configuring and Receiving Event Notifications
---------------------------------------------

The EvoStream Media Server (EMS) generates notifications based upon events that occur at runtime. These events are formatted as HTTP calls and can be delivered to any address and port desired.

Event Notifications are **disabled** by default and must be enabled by modifying the EMS config file: config.lua.

To enable Event Notifications you will need to Enable/Uncomment the *eventLogger* section of the config.lua file. *Comments in LUA are specified by either a "--" for a single line, or denoted by a "--\[[" to start a comment block and a "]]--" to end a comment block. By default the eventLogger section is commented out using block style comments, so you will need to remove both the* "**--\[\[**" *and* "**]]--**" *strings.* See the Configuration Files section for more information.

### Sinks

Sinks are defined as "a specific destination for events" and can be of two types: "file" and "RPC". File sinks simply write events to a file, as defined by the "filename" parameter. This works much like a system logger. Users can choose the format of the output between JSON, XML, W3C and text. JSON and XML will be formatted as JSON and XML respectively and each event will be written to a single line. This is done for ease of parsing. The W3C formatted file is compliant with the requirement of having space or tab-delimited columns. In addition, it has a header line that is commented out (#) that indicates the names of the columns. As with JSON and XML, each event is also written to a single line. The Text format writes to the event file in a way that is easy to read, where events are on multiple lines. *The file sink is* _ **off** _ *by default,* but can be turned on by creating the sink in the config.lua file.

To receive HTTP based Event Notifications, an RPC type sink must be defined (and is by default). The URL parameter defines the location that will be called with each event. The URL can be a specific web service script or just an IP and port on which you are listening. RPC sinks have the option of one of three serializer types, or in other words, the way the data will be formatted within the HTTP post: JSON, XML, XMLRPC. XMLRPC events will be formatted as XML using a traditional XML-RPC schema. The XML serializer type will use an XML schema that is more condensed and specific to the EMS Event Notification System. The JSON serializer type will have the same schema as XML, but will be formatted as JSON.

For any Sink, users can define an array of *enabledEvents*. When this array is present, ONLY the events listed will be sent to that sink. If this array is not present, ALL events will be sent to the sink. The full list of events can be found later in this document.

---

User Defined Variables
----------------------

While the EMS provides an extensive set of API functions, there may be times where the variables provided are not sufficient, or where you may need extra information to be associated with individual streams. To support these needs, the EMS API implements User Defined Variables. User Defined Variables can be used with any API function where information is maintained by the EMS (i.e. pulling a stream, creating a timer, starting a transcode job, etc.).

To specify a User Defined Variable, you simply need to append a '\_' to the beginning of your variable name. The User Defined variables are reported back whenever you get information about the command: listStreams, listConfig, Event Notifications, etc.

Some common use cases for User Defined Variables are as follows:

1.	Setting a timer to stop a stream after a set period of time

```
setTimer value=120 \_streamName=MyStreamsetTimer value=120 \_streamID=5
```

pullstream uri=rtmp://192.168.1.5/live/myStream localstreamname=test1 \_myID=5 \_myName=secretSquirrel

These commands will fire a timer event after 120 seconds with the set stream name or stream id respectively.

1.	Attach a custom identifier to a local stream
2.	Set a custom value on a pushed stream

```
pushstream uri=rtmp://192.168.1.5/live/myStream localstreamname=test1 \_myID=5 \_myName=secretSquirrel
```

---

Streams vs Stream Configs and API Command Return Values
-------------------------------------------------------

Issuing commands to the EvoStream Media Server is an Asynchronous event. This means that a successfully issued command will not actually be executed immediately. It will instead be Queued for execution. While this generally transparent for the user, there is an important ramification of this reality:

**When the EMS returns SUCCESS for an issued API command, this only means that the command was successfully QUEUED. IT DOES NOT MEAN THAT THE COMMAND WAS SUCCESSFULLY EXECUTED!**

For example, a pullStream command may return SUCCESS, but the stream may not have actually been pulled!

More details on why this occurs follows.

### Stream Configs

When an API command is issued, it creates a Stream Config entry. Each Stream Config is a list of parameters which instructs EMS to take an action. As a result of that action, a stream may be born. At the time at which the command is executed (stream config is created), there is absolutely no guarantee that the action will indeed spawn a stream. There is a very good reason for this behavior. The action itself doesn't solely depend on EMS. In the case of **pullStream,** the success of the command greatly depends on the distant party being invoked to send the stream in question. If that distant party doesn't do that, then the stream can't be created. To summarize, stream config is only the blueprint of the future stream, nothing less, and nothing more.

Stream Configs also have a unique, monotonically increasing ID. This is completely different from the "stream id". When listConfig is used, it will output the format described in the "API Definiion.pdf". Notice the configId value for each node. The listing of the configurations also contains the current status of the stream and the previous status. Finally, removeConfig can be used to terminate a configuration and the corresponding stream (if ever spawned)

### Streams

Streams are the active streams currently managed by EMS. They may or may not have an associated config. That is because the stream could be pushed/pulled into/from EMS by a distant party, without any execution of a pushStream/pullStream command. For example, an Adobe flash application does a "publish" or a "play". However, when a stream is born due to a pullStream/pushStream/etc API command, that stream Will have an associated config. listStreams will list all streams regardless of their nature: pulled/pushed by EMS or from 3rd party apps like explained in the Adobe example above. When a stream is actively pushed/pulled by EMS, the node describing that stream will also contain a sub node with the configuration (the stream config explained above). shutdownStream, as the name implies, acts on a stream, not on a stream config. That is why you can't do a shutdownStream on a stream name which is not present BUT was configured. The permanently=1 parameter is provided to save an extra call to removeConfig call, but, again, that is only making sense when the stream is active. The streams information returned by listStreams contains a unique id for each and every stream node. That is what we refer to as "stream id".

**To summarize the above:** _ **streamID** _ **is different from** _ **configID** _ **because they signify two different kinds of entities.**

EvoStream Media Server API
==========================

The EMS API can be broken down into a few groups of functionality. The first group, and the one most often used, is Stream Manipulation. The other groups are Connection Details and Services which are discussed later in the document.

Each API function is listed along with its mandatory and optional parameters. Examples of each interface can be found after the description of function parameters.

**PLEASE NOTE:**

**All Boolean parameters are set using 1 for true and 0 for false!**

**Default values of parameters shown in parentheses or italicized are just remarks.**

**Special Parameter:**

There is a special parameter that can be used in all API commands:

commandID - If set to any value, the corresponding message will have a parameter responseId set to the same value. This is used to match the responses to the corresponding commands.

To use, simply add commandID=<value> as an additional parameter

| API                                     | APIcommand [someParameters] commandID=0101   |
|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| JSON Response                           | {"data":{…"description":"*API description*", |
| "responseId" :"0101","status":"SUCCESS" |                                              |


Streams
-------

Streams are considered to be the actual video and/or audio feeds that are coming from, or going to, the EMS. Streams can be sent over a wide variety of protocols. The following functions are provided to manipulate and query Streams:

**IMPORTANT:** All Stream Names are **case sensitive** for all API functions!

### pullStream

This will try to pull in a stream from an external source. Once a stream has been successfully pulled it is assigned a "local stream name" which can be used to access the stream from the EMS.

This function has the following parameters:

| **Parameter Name**    | **Mandatory**                                            | **Default Value**         | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

An example of the pullStream interface is:

```
pullStream uri=rtsp://AddressOfStream keepAlive=1 localStreamname=RTSPtest
```

rtsp://AddressOfEMS:5544/RTSPtest

pullStream uri=rtmp://AddressOfStream keepAlive=1 localStreamname=RTMPtest

Then, to access that stream via a flash player, the following URI can be used:

```
rtmp://AddressOfEMS/live/RTMPtest
```

The JSON response for pullStream contains the following details:

-	data – The data to parse.

	-	audioCodecBytes - The audio codec setup of this RTP stream if it is audio
	-	configID – The configuration ID for this command
	-	emulateUserAgent – This is the string that the EMS uses to identify itself with the other server. It can be modified so that EMS identifies itself as, say, a Flash Media Server
	-	forceTcp – Whether TCP MUST be used, or if UDP can be used
	-	httpProxy - May either be IP:Port combination or self
	-	isAudio - Indicates if the currently pulled stream is an audio source

### pushStream

This will try to push a local stream to an external destination. The pushed stream can only use the RTMP, RTSP or MPEG-TS unicast/multicast protocol. This function has the following parameters:

| **Parameter Name**     | **Mandatory** | **Default Value**         | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

An example of the createDASHStream interface is:

```
createDASHStream localstreamnames=dashtest bandwidth=128 targetfolder=/MyWebRoot/ groupname=group1 rolling=true rollingLimit=10 chunkLength=10
```

To playback the created DASH stream, use a DASH player such as the following:

```
http://digitalprimates.net/dash/dashTest.html
```

This player is the most stable for EMS DASH playback but it doesn't support live profile for EMS DASH.

Enter the following stream URL:

```
http://My\_IP\_or\_Domain/group1/manifest.mpd
```

In other words: http://<my\_web\_server>/<dash\_group\_name>/<manifest\_file\_name>

An alternative DASH player, GPAC Osmo4, can be downloaded from here:

[http://gpac.wp.mines-telecom.fr/downloads/gpac-nightly-builds/](http://gpac.wp.mines-telecom.fr/downloads/gpac-nightly-builds/)

This player supports MPEG-DASH live profile for EMS DASH.

Another DASH player, Dash.as, can be downloaded from here:

### record

Records any inbound stream. The record command allows users to record a stream that may not yet exist. When a new stream is brought into the server, it is checked against a list of streams to be recorded.

Streams can be recorded as FLV files, MPEG-TS files or as MP4 files.

### transcode

This function changes the compression characteristics of an audio and/or video stream. This function allows you to change the resolution of a source stream, change the bitrate of a stream, change a VP8 or MPEG2 stream into H.264 and much more. This function will also allow users to create overlays on the final stream as well as crop streams.

**Transcoding requires SIGNIFICANT computing resources and will severely impact performance. A general guideline is that you can accomplish one transcoding job per CPU core for HD streams.**

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

-	For any parameter that is pluralized, you may specify one value, or multiple. Multiple values must be separated by only a comma (comma-delimited). Specifying multiple values indicates multiple new streams will be created.
-	There must be the same number of values for all pluralized parameters. Oder is important: all first values are grouped together to make the first stream, all second parameters are grouped to make the second stream, etc…
-	Video related parameters are ignored if the parameter _ **videoBitrates** _ is not specified.
-	Audio related parameters are ignored if the parameter _ **audioBitrates** _ is not specified.

This function has the following parameters:

| **Parameter Name**          | **Mandatory** | **Default Value**                | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

An example of the transcode command is:

```
transcode source=rtmp://<RTMP server>/live/streamname groupName=group videoBitrates=200k destinations=stream1
```

```
transcode source=rtmp://<RTMP server>/live/streamname groupName=group videoBitrates=100k,200k,300k destinations=stream100,stream200,stream300
```

**Transcode Examples:**

To transcode an RTMP source into different video bitrates and send back to EMS

```
transcode source=stream1 groupName=group audioBitrates=copy audioChannelsCounts=1 destinations=rtmp://<RTMP server 2> targetStreamNames=streamMono
```

To transcode an existing EMS stream into a different audio channel count and send to an RTMP server

```
transcode source=file://C:\videos\test.mp4 groupName=group videoBitrates=100k audioBitrates=copy destinations=file://C:\videos\out.mp4
```

To use files as input and/or output

```
transcode source=rtsp://<RTSP server>/live/streamname groupName=group videoBitrates=copy videoSizes=360x200 $EMS\_RTSP\_TRANSPORT=tcp
```

To force TCP for inbound RTSP

```
removeConfig groupName=group
```

To stop a running transcoding process(es)

**Transcoding Customizations:**

transcoder = { scriptPath="emsTranscoder", srcUriPrefix="rtsp://localhost:5544/", dstUriPrefix="-f flv tcp://localhost:6666/" },

To configure the transcoder script settings, edit the file **config.lua** and edit the following entries as needed:

To change the location of the actual trancoder binary, edit the file **emsTranscoder.sh** (linux/unix) and **emsTranscoder.cmd** (windows); and change the following line:

TRANSCODER\_BIN=/usr/bin/evo-avconv (linux/unix)

set TRANSCODER\_BIN=..\evo-avconv.exe (windows)

### listConfig

Returns a list with all push/pull configurations.

Whenever the pullStream or pushStream interfaces are called, a record containing the details of the pull or push is created in the pullpushconfig.xml file. Then, the next time the EMS is started, the pullpushconfig.xml file is read, and the EMS attempts to reconnect all of the previous pulled or pushed streams.

This function has no parameters.

An example of the launchProcess command is:

```
launchProcess fullBinaryPath=/home/ems/ffmpeg\_preset.sh arguments=10fps\ Stream1\ Stream1\_10fps keepAlive=1 $SAMPLE\_E\_VAR=MyVal
```

This sample command launches a script, named ffmpeg\_prest.sh, which presumably contains a shell-script that will run FFMPEG with a specific set of parameters.

The arguments field passes the three values ("10fps", "Stream1", "Stream1\_10fps") to the ffmpeg\_preset.sh script. In this example, these parameters might tell this hypothetical script to transcode Stream1 to be only 10 frames-per-second, and then name the resultant stream "Stream1\_10fps".

The final parameter is an example for setting an environment variable (SAMPLE\_E\_VAR set to MyVal) on the command line prior to script/binary execution.

### generateServerPlaylist

Will create a server-side playlist with the specified sources.

This function has the following parameters:

| **Parameter Name** | **Mandatory** | **Default Value**      | **Description**                                                                                                               |
|--------------------|---------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| sources            | true          | *(null)*               | The stream or media file source(s) to be used as input. This is a comma-delimited list of active stream names or media files. |
| pathToFile         | true          | *(null)*               | The path to the output server playlist file.                                                                                  |
| sourceOffsets      | false         | *(zero-length) string* | The corresponding offsets for the source streams/files listed in sources. This can be a comma-delimited list.                 |
| durations          | false         | *(zero-length string)* | The corresponding durations for the source streams/files listed in sources. This can be a comma-delimited list.               |

**sourceOffsets** and **durations** specify what part of the source stream/file to play for each of the items listed and for how long. The values for **sourceOffsets** and **durations** are defined specifically as follows:

-	**sourceOffsets** specifies the starting position, in seconds, for each of the source stream/file. This parameter can also be used to indicate whether the stream is live or a media file.
	-	-2 means that the EMS will look for a live stream with the source name specified. If a live stream is not found, it will attempt to play a media file with the source name. If a media file with that name and path cannot be found the EMS will wait for a live stream to become available.
	-	-1 implies that the source is explicitly a live stream. If no live stream is found, the EMS waits indefinitely if *duration* is set to -1. If *duration* is another value the EMS will wait *duration* seconds before moving to the next item in the playlist.
	-	0 or a positive number implies that the specified source is a media file. The EMS will start playback *sourceOffset* seconds from the beginning of the file. If no file is found the playlist item is skipped.
	-	Any negative number other than -1 or -2 will be assumed to be -2
-	**durations** specifies the length of the playback of each of the sources in seconds.
	-	All positive numbers will cause the EMS to play the stream/file for *duration* seconds or until the end of the media file or live stream, whichever comes first.
	-	0 means that only a single frame of the stream/file will be played.
	-	-1 means that the EMS will play a live stream until it is no longer available or a media file until its end.
	-	-2 will play media files until their end (same as -1 behavior). For live sources, it will play the live stream until that stream is no longer available. When the source stream is lost the EMS shall move to the next item in the playlist.
	-	Any negative number other than -1 or -2 will be assumed to be -2.

An example of the generateServerPlaylist interface is:

```
generateServerPlaylist sources=File1.mp4,livestream1,File2.mp4,livestream1 pathToFile=/MyFileDirectory/MyPlaylist.lst sourceOffsets=0,-1,0,-1 durations=-1,60,-1,-1
```

| API           | generateServerPlaylist sources=bunnyA.mp4,bunnyB.mp4 pathToFile=../media/testPlaylist sourceOffsets=0,-1 durations=-1,60                                                                                                     |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| JSON Response | {"data":{"durations":[-1,60],"pathToFile":"..\/media\/testPlaylist","sourceOffsets":[0,-1],"sources":["bunnyA.mp4","bunnyB.mp4"]},"description":"Server playlist written to ..\/media\/testPlaylist.lst","status":"SUCCESS"} |

### insertPlaylistItem

Inserts a new item into an RTMP playlist. insertPlaylistItem may be called on playlists which are actively being played by one or more clients/players.

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

-	This function does NOT modify the actual playlist file. Instead it modifies ONLY the in-memory copy of the file.
-	The sourceOffset and duration parameters behave exactly as they do when creating Playlist Files. However, they are measured in **MILLISECONDS** as opposed to seconds.

This function has the following parameters:

| sourceOffset       | false         | *-2000*           | Specifies the starting position, in milliseconds, of the source stream. This parameter can also be used to indicate whether the stream is live or recorded.-2000 means that the EMS will look for a live stream with the localStreamName specified. If a live stream is not found, it will attempt to play a media file with the localStreamName. If a media file with that name and path cannot be found the EMS will wait for a live stream to become available.-1000 implies that the localStreamName is explicitly a live stream. If no live stream is found, the EMS waits indefinitely if *duration* is set to -1. If *duration* is another value the EMS will wait *duration* seconds before moving to the next item in the playlist.0 or a positive number implies that the specified localStreamName is a media file. The EMS will start playback sourceOffset milliseconds from the beginning of the file. If no file is found the playlist item is skipped.Any negative number other than -1000 or -2000 will be assumed to be -2000 |
| duration           | false         | *-1000*           | The duration of the playback of the stream in milliseconds.-1000 means that the EMS will play a live stream until it is no longer available or a media file until its end.0 means that only a single frame of the stream will be played.All positive numbers will cause the EMS to play the stream for duration milliseconds or until the end of the media file or live stream, whichever comes first.Any negative number passed other than -1000 will be assumed to be -1000                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

### uploadMedia

Creates an acceptor which receives an HTTP POST binary upload. The acceptor will be opened on a specified port and the uploaded media file will be written on a specified directory. The acceptor then waits for an HTTP PUT from a client with the media file as payload. The media file is then written on the specified location in the server.

This function has the following parameters:

| **Parameter Name** | **Mandatory** | **Default Value** | **Description**                                        |
|--------------------|---------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| port               | true          | *(null)*          | The port value to bind on.                             |
| targetFolder       | true          | *(null)*          | The folder where the binary upload will be serialized. |

The sending client must conform to the following:

-	It must send the data by way of HTTP POST.
-	The POST request must be in http/1.1 format.
-	A StreamName must be provided in the POST line. This will then be the filename of the media file (mp4) when written. (e.g., *POST /mystreamname HTTP/1.1\r\n*\)
-	Content-type must be set to *video/mp4* or *application/octet-stream*.
-	Content-length must be used. This function is intended for uploading VOD MP4 so the EMS will expect that the size of the file is already known.

An example of the uploadMedia interface is:

```
uploadMedia port=3333 targetFolder=/MyMediaFolder
```

| API           | uploadMedia port=3333 targetFolder=../media                                                                                              |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| JSON Response | {"data":{"ip":"0.0.0.0","port":3333,"targetFolder":"..\/media"},"description":"Media upload acceptor configuration.","status":"SUCCESS"} |

The JSON response contains the following details:

-	data – The data to parse.
	-	ip – The IP referring to the EMS, normally 0.0.0.0.
	-	port – The specified port number where the acceptor will wait for HTTP POSTs.
	-	targetFolder – The specified folder where the media file will be written.
-	description – Describes the result of parsing/executing the command.
-	status – `SUCCESS` if the command was parsed and executed successfully, `FAIL` if not.

A typical response in parsed JSON format is shown here: uploadMedia

### getMetadata

Returns the most recently received string currently cached by the Metadata Manager. The call is stateless so multiple clients may each poll for metadata with no impact on each other. This may result in getting the same string multiple times if no new string has arrived.

This function has the following parameters:

| **Parameter Name** | **Mandatory** | **Default Value** | **Description**                                                                                            |

| localStreamName    | false         | *(null)*          | Name of the incoming stream from which the associated metadata will be returned. Default most recent.      |
| streamId           | false         | *0*               | Identifies the particular stream from which the associated metadata will be returned. Default most recent. |
| noWrap             | false         | *0 (false)*       | If true, the returned string will not have the CLI JSON wrapping.                                          |
